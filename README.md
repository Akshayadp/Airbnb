# Airbnb

This project is built with MongoDB Atlas sample Airbnb dataset, our objective is to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) by performing data cleaning. Ultimately, we aim to represent the insightful findings in a visually compelling format using Power BI.

# Problem Statement

The goals of this project, including analyzing Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas, conducting data cleaning and preparation, and utilizing geospatial visualizations and dynamic plots to uncover insights related to pricing, availability, and location-based trends.

# Objective
The project's objective is Airbnb data visualization techniques for better understanding of the dataset. It aims to leverage Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Intelligence tools, such as Power BI, to visually interpret the data and extract meaningful insights.

# Libraries

* pandas
* streamlit
* plotly
* matplotlib

# Features
*  Establish a connection to the MongoDB Atlas database and retrieve the Airbnb dataset.
* Clean the Airbnb dataset by addressing missing values, eliminating duplicates, and adjusting data types as required. Prepare the dataset for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization tasks, ensuring data integrity and consistency throughout the process.
* Utilize the cleaned data to conduct an analysis and visualization of price variations across different locations, property types, and seasons. Develop dynamic plots and charts that empower users to explore trends in pricing, identify outliers, and discern correlations with other variables.
* Power BI to craft a comprehensive dashboard showcasing key insights derived from your analysis. Integrate various visualizations, including maps, charts, and tables, to offer a holistic perspective on the Airbnb dataset and its underlying patterns.
* The final output of my project aims to provide an easily accessible analysis of Airbnb data for clients and users, particularly those interested in tourism and hotel visits. This analysis includes features such as hotel types, average prices, minimum and maximum prices, types of rooms, available facilities, and a map for convenient exploration.
